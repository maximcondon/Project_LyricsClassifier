    "- Based on Bayes' Theorem - it **describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.** For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes' theorem, a person's age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age.\n",

This is not as much of a problem for our classifier as you might think. Why? Because we don’t care what the true posterior value is, we only care which class has a the highest posterior value. And because the marginal probability is the same for all classes 1) we can ignore the denominator, 2) calculate only the posterior’s numerator for each class, and 3) pick the largest numerator. That is, we can ignore the posterior’s denominator and make a prediction solely on the relative values of the posterior’s numerator.\n"
