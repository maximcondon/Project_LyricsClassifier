There must be something deep down in the middle down there He’s not too easily scared He’s got friends but they got the feeling Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared Oh, look, see there he is now coming down the stairs (Here he comes) He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (yeah) 'Cause he doesn’t like it looking like he looks back He talks like his opinion is a simple fact Somebody grabbed his collar He cried the whole way home He won’t remember a thing 'til it starts again That’s how it is 'til the end (yeah)"

And imagine if I showed you that I found another way of getting dough without doing dirt-- let's blurt Would you love me for giving me some hope Or resent me 'cause your pride got hurt? Imagine if we never grew up on a council estate And was country manor raised with a spoon in our mouth Would we still be making fuss about the East and the South Would we shiver at the robberies, murder and the crack And thank god that we didn't have to live like that Just the image on the TV as we're comfortably sat Sipping wine, room lit by the summer sunshine Not a worry in the world as we casually chat Oblivious to how we would be living on the flipside No experience, not a clue about a rough ride No harassment, no boy dem (?) on our backside That would be *amazing*, still I know you wonder would make you any less real? What's the corresponding standing in (?), offering If you had a better offer would you go for the kill? Snap out of your daydream, how do you feel? Does it all seem worthwhile for ya? Try and put it in perspective Retrospective of your profile and your honor Do you want to hang about, or are you a goner? Come along, think fast, decision time You've been living in the grime, don't you want to climb? The ladder of life, the wall of enlightenment Or are you looking for the hype and excitement? 'cause with so much drama in the LDN It's kind of hard to find legal money to spend Generation genocide looks possible The rate at which we draw for this game and pretend But we don't know who the real enemy is Who should be held responsible, instead we defend A couple square meters of pavement, in the end What will be achieved my friends?"

An I walk it like I talk it, brother ain't just hype, Makin' moves for the money everyday an every night. Best to believe I keep it tight, best to believe I'm movin' right, Keep my business on the low, you best to believe I'm outta sight I like money money money, girls girls, cash cash, I'll let the champagne splash. Yo, I'm not a gang banger but I'm good with a mash, Make you scratch your head an wonder is he really that flash But it really doesn't matter 'cause you know I keep it movin, Middle of the dance floor, lean, I'm grooving. Baby cocked her bumper out, you know I gotta wind it, When we leave the club I'm really gonna get behind it. [Chorus: x2] Nike air bubbles on my feet, lookin' fresh, Got my brand new garms on, dress to impress. Got my phone line poppin, all these beanies gotta crush, Keep something in my pocket case these fellas try an rush. Brown eyes, five ten, dark skin, Mr Dizzee rascal, why you even askin'. Under cover lover, girls call me buff ting, but, Used to keep a balaclava restin' on my chin. An it's the ends here, hustle hustle, bling bing, blow it in, About to hear the fat lady sing. Don't matter what I'm sayin, it's the answer within, but, Life's a jungle, everybody wants to be the king. But it's alright though, I got my eyes on the prize, Money in my draw, bigger picture in my eyes. Hands around my testicles, little finger risen, Every step that I take is a step with precision. I'm precise, precisely why my future's lookin' nice, The penthouse is lovely, it's a shame about the price. But you only live twice, that's on the real, No matter where I am I'll always be the real deal. [Chorus] Education starts with discipline, I'm listenin', But conversations kinda muffled since I got rich and tings. Double turn, indirectly spoke, I never heard a thing, Under ground or overground, what's the difference I'm the king. Learnt devine right, its my heinsight. I see it all, 'cause I ain't that fake to spread my wings an fly, you're a fool. Talkin' like you're mighty and you're high, But I know you're small, there's no logic in your gossip, Just the writings on the wall. Over ignorant, you ain't got it, you just play far, Far from the realist old dog, menace, you're a mark. If you're deep, why you gotta roll fifty to the club, Blood, who d'you think your foolin' with that fake crew love. The streets don't cater for no long term plan, These roads don't give a damn about any man. I try an show these brothers, they refuse to understand, So I'll just keep doin' what I'm doin' while I can. [Chorus] East side crew, west side crew, north side crew, south side crew. East side crew, west side crew, north side crew, saw side crew."

One day I was with my bredwin 'A dot' roaming the streets On the main road hungry looking for something to eat Not no burger and no chips that's easily digested That shit that if your caught, you'll be easing arrested We was on the robin street I forgot to mention Kate There was this Breda rolling with us he was scared it was blait, And he was high But, back to the story 'A dot' spotted the man Straight ahead of us in the distance with his wifey holding hands So we followed him through this little alleyway into the flats And we thought the time was perfect so we crept up and we attacked I took the first swing unexpected causing panic We was ruthless causing agony in public it was tragic Me and 'A dot' lost the plot, acting like we were from hell Beat this Breda to the floor beat his wifey up as well Clayton stood back shaking, wishing that he never came When from out of nowhere there was Alisha screaming my name She went my school She saw it all To make it worse I'm hearing sirens, I ain't even trying handle [Chorus:Repeat x2] I can hear the sirens coming [Repeat x2] I break the law; I will never change [Repeat x3] Step into my soul get your whole face rearranged See me on the tele but I ain't no actor Running through the streets brave face it's a jack one Real day light no shame like a lunatic Rain, hell, sleet or snow I ain't new to it Show me what you got betta give it up quickly Lay them on their back if they try and fight swiftly Better mind out when they come through the manner man Keep em on their toes like hammer man It's no joke man woman and child I'm seeking See no skets no age I'm creeping Anything through the door cold on the wheelers Duck from the feds and I roll with the Dealers Smile with your heart and stand on a senteence, My last day wasn't like Eastenders Step into my soul get your whole face rearranged I break the law I will never change"

Save your sympathy My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe If you believe then you can achieve Just look at me Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on To all the seeds that follow me Protect your essence Born with less, but you still precious Just smile for me now [Chorus: Johnny P (2Pac)] Smile for me , won't you smile (smile for me now) Just smile (smile), smile for me (What ya looking all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now) Smile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about) Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smile (And the next generation) [Scarface] Now as I open up my story With the blaze a your blunts And you can picture thoughts slowly Up on phrases I wrote And I can walk you through the days that I done I often wish that I could save everyone But I'm a dreamer Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came? Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile Smile [Chorus] [2Pac] Fuck the world as we ? and witness furious speeds Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames Will I be smothered by my own pain? Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me Somebody save me Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain Embrace my words make the world change And still I smile nigga [Scarface] And now a moment of silence, let us pray And as you journey into outer space May the angels help to lead the way Shine up on your soul to keep you safe And all the homies that done passed away They there to greet you as you pass the gates And as you headed to the tunnel's light I hope it leads to eternal life We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac Smile (Smile for me) (All ya need to do is smile) (Woo smile for me) (Come on smile for me)"

The social worker's here everyday Now Brenda's got to make her own way Can't go to her family: they won't let her stay No money, no babysitter; she couldn't keep a job She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed So, now, what's next? It ain't nothin' left to sell So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name She's got a baby (Baby) (I want you to know she's gotta...

Just holla my name And witness game official. Niggas is so shame; They stare stiff like scared bitches, While I remain inside a paradox. Gone my block; Though gun shots is promised to me; when will I stop? I hit the weed And hope to god I can fly high. Witness my enemies Die when I ride by; They shouldn'ta tried me. Send they bodies to they parents, up north, With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off. Fuck 'em all, what I scream as I dream in tones, Fuck a trick, get me rich 'n the bitches'll come, Bust ma gun; make 'em all scatta. Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatta. Eat her dead, biatch, mercy, neva that. You said you comin' back; bring it on, fo'ever straped. Introduce ya to tha pleasure 'n tha pain, You could go so far; just sell me ya soul; live tha life of a ghetto star. I live the life of thug nigga, drug deala, livin' game tight. Mug nigga, slug nigga, split tha fame like... Laced with game; practice on takin' pain; equipped same, And let it rain through ya brain. Street smart, proficient, intellegent, and keep suckas hittin' till snitchs start smellin'. Movin' niggaz with telekinesis; keepin' channel at work feelin' different features, Leadin' niggaz to an early death with they head blown, And to those who didn't make it to the morgue, Which is dead 'n gone. And hope niggaz got fun, kidnapped, jacked in the back with next to they cataracts? They get done, Back chat, they toast his ass out. Mob related momma, my nigga, found shot up with his dick in his mouth; print it. My name in these streets, as a mutha fuckin' g, now the next generation's lookin' worse off than me. Walkin' through tha cemetery; talkin' to my homies that was buried. Say my enemies want to see me dead; I ain't worried; forgive me. Please give me shelter; calm my fears. Lifted my head from my hand that'll ball me tears. I see bodies gettin' splashed with acid. Two shots ring from the plasted guy wrapped in plastic; Bury tha bastard; time to notify His family...shit. Ain't nothin' left to be identify. Evacuate the crime scene fast; why? I heard the feds have a warrant fo' my ass; fly. I won't touch down till I see tijauna. Setup a shop sellin' them crooked cops marijuana. Label me a success; I made tha switch; retired from the life that neva gave me shit, But cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars, and adict fo' a wife; to my life as a ghetto star."

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate, how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if ya hold on It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady And dear mama Place no one above ya, sweet lady You are appreciated Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady And dear mama Dear mama Lady, lady, lady"

Who are we fooling? Hell is hot, fire is proven To burn for eternity, return of the student That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it Tired of running, choirs is humming Tell us to visit, we lying about coming Now back to business, loading the guns in Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed And the beef is bubbling It's no discussion, hereditary All of my cousins Dying of thirst Dying of thirst Dying of thirst Too many sins I'm running out Somebody send Me a well for the drought See, all I know, is taking notes On taking this life for granted Granted, if he provoke My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...) My best days, I stress days Say ""Fuck the world,"" my sex slave Money, pussy and greed was my next crave Whatever it is, know it's my next grave Tired of running, tired of running Tired of tumbling, tired of running Tired of tumbling Back once my momma say ""See a pastor, give me a promise What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest You dying of thirst You dying of thirst So hop in that water, and pray that it works"""

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil That’s how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, The poor people is gonna open up this whole world And swallow up the rich people 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetizing, You know what I’m saying, wealthy, appetizing The poor gonna be so poor and hungry You know what I’m saying it’s gonna be like There might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich Aight so let me ask you this then, Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich Or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities? I see myself as a natural born hustler, A true hustler in every sense of the word, I took nothin’ I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it I went from having somebody manage me To me hiring the person that works my management company I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years You know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself, You know what I’m saying I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us And through your different avenues of success How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, And by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true You know what I’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening So it’s no problem, you know I mean it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know I’m finna go straight through Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart Or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance And not only me but it goes down my family tree You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win and I wanna lay it all down In this country a black man only have like five years we can exhibit maximum strength And that’s right now while you a teenager While you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, While you still wanna shoot back 'Cause once you turn thirty it’s like they take the heart and soul out of a man Out of a black man in this country And you don’t wanna fight no more And if you don’t believe me you can look around, You don’t see no loud mouth thirty-year old muthafuckas That’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on So I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores And next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real I don’t think America can know that I think American think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing But it ain’t gonna be no playing It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying, It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen That’s crazy man. In my opinion only hope that we kinda have left Is music and vibrations Lotta people don’t understand how important it is Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic And I don’t know what type of energy I’mma push out, Or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes Because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’ We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us Damn I wanted to read one last thing to you It’s actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world It says ""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits Already surrounded by this mad city The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him He can no longer see past his own thoughts He’s trapped When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots Such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city The result? Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations That the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different They are one and the same"" What’s your perspective on that?
