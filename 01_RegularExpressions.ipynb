And while there is a lot of theory behind formal languages, the following lessons and examples will explore the more practical uses of regular expressions so that you can use them as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to recognize when using regular expressions is that everything is essentially a character, and we are writing patterns to match a specific sequence of characters (also known as a string). Most patterns use normal ASCII, which includes letters, digits, punctuation and other symbols on your keyboard like %#$@!, but unicode characters can also be used to match any type of international text.\n",

In this case, the character **\\d** can be used in place of any digit from 0 to 9. The preceding slash distinguishes it from the simple d character and indicates that it is a metacharacter.\n",

For example, to match the donations above, we can use the pattern \\d* to match any number of digits, but a tighter regular expression would be **\\d+** which ensures that the input string has at least one digit.\n",

That is why it is often best practice to write as specific regular expressions as possible to ensure that we don't get false positives when matching against real world text.\n",

In the example above, we can use the pattern ^success to match only a line that begins with the word \"success\", but not the line \"Error: unsuccessful operation\". And if you combine both the hat and the dollar sign, you create a pattern that matches the whole line completely at the beginning and end.\n",
